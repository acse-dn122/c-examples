/*
• Write a function that divides one number by another one a/b,
  – double divide(double a, double b)

• Write a main that loops over 10,000 pairs of random doubles (between 0
and 1), divides them and accumulates the division into a variable
total_div.

• Handle the possible error that can be caused by dividing by a zero value.
Try first without exceptions. Then try to use a standard exception. Then
create your own exception to handle this error.

• Handle the possible error that can be caused by dividing by a zero value,
using assert. Run your programme in Release and Debug mode. What is
the difference?
